-- A murder has occurred in SQL City. It happened on Jan 15th, 2018.

--First witness: Morty Schapiro, I heard a gun shot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag.
--The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
